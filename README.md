# SegModelOpt
## Overview

This repository demonstrates training, optimizing, and compressing deep learning models for medical image segmentation. It currently focuses on U-Net, but will expand to other architectures in the future. The optimization techniques explored include:
1. Quantization. (Post-Training Quantization, Quantization-Aware Training)
2. Pruning.
3. Model Distillation (planned future work)
4. Trying networs beyond U-net. (UNet++,Mobile-UNet, DeepLabV3 / DeepLabV3+,  Mask R-CNN)

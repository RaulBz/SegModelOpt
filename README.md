# SegModelOpt
## Overview

This repository demonstrates training, optimizing, and compressing deep learning models for medical image segmentation. It currently focuses on U-Net, but will expand to other architectures in the future. The optimization techniques explored include:
	•	Quantization (Post-Training Quantization, Quantization-Aware Training)
	•	Pruning (Weight Pruning, Structured & Unstructured Pruning)
	•	Model Distillation (planned future work)
	•	Other Efficiency Techniques (TensorRT, ONNX optimization)

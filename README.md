# SegModelOpt
## Overview

This repository demonstrates training, optimizing, and compressing deep learning models for medical image segmentation. It currently focuses on U-Net, but will expand to other architectures in the future. The optimization techniques explored include:
1. Quantization:
 	•	Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
	•	Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
3. Pruning.
4. Mixed precission.
5. Change Dataset to medical Images:
	• LiTS - Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094
  • Medical Segmentation Decathlon: http://medicaldecathlon.com/
7. Trying networs beyond U-net(Future Work):
	•	UNet++
	•	Mobile-UNet
	•	DeepLabV3 / DeepLabV3+
	•	Mask R-CNN


## 🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧
This project is in its early stages and is actively evolving. The current implementation serves as a code skeleton, and several improvements are planned, including:
	•	Better model training (e.g., more epochs, adaptive learning rates, improved loss functions)
	•	Refactoring and improved code structure
	•	Enhanced optimization techniques

Expect frequent updates and breaking changes as the project progresses.
